    **Why Python for statistics?**

    R is a language dedicated to statistics. Python is a general purpose
    language with statistics module. R has more statistical analysis
    features than Python, and specialized syntaxes. However, when it
    comes to building complex analysis pipelines that mix statistics with
    e.g. image analysis, text mining, or control of a physical
    experiment, the richness of Python is an invaluable asset.

   To install Python, we recommend that you download `Anaconda Python
