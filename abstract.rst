Statistics in Python
=====================

This tutorial will focus on inferential and exploratory statistics in
Python: modelling statistical relationship between variable. It will not
be a tutorial on predictive modeling, ie machine learning. The teaching
objectives are:

* from a theoretical standpoint to understand estimation, confidence 
  intervals and hypothesis testing

* from a practical standpoint, to know how to visually conjecture
  relationships in the data

The core Python technologies covered will be pandas and statsmodels in
addition to numpy and scipy.

The tutorial will be an extended version of the material in part 1 of
